# Razi's Home Task (Will be updated at the end of the project)
* This project is using React(17.0.01) & Redux /w redux-thunk for api's
* This project is structured based on the MVC approach, seperating each page to page(model) / view / controller
* Linting: ESlint abnb with some minor personal adjustments
- Libs used:
    * Semantic UI React
    * 

## Misc. Notes
* I ejected the project to edit the ESLint plugin in webpack, for some reason ESLint was failing the project compilation due to warnings, and this is a quick fix I found.

* This project assumes we would communicate with our server using a token of some sort
